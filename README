This plugin allows you to add ballon popup on your site leveraging the jquery features. Using this plugin is very simple.
Include balloon_popup.css then add jQuery.js, balloon_popup.js in head of your web page.
Add 'balloon' class to html element on which you want popup on mouseover.
Add html attribute message whose value is the message that needs to be displayed in balloon popup. For ex:

<div class='balloon' message='Test message'>Some conetent</div>

After doing this you need to initialize ballon popup, that can be done using the following code:

$(document).ready(fucntion(){
	$('.balloon').ballon_popup();
})

That's all.
